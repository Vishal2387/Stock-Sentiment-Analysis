# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-using-News-Headlines

The data set in consideration is a combination of the world news and stock price shifts available on kaggle.


There are 25 columns of top news headlines for each day in the data frame.


Data ranges from 2008 to 2016 and the data from 2000 to 2008 was scrapped from Yahoo finance.


Lables are based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index.


Class 1--> The stock price increased.


Class 0--> The stock price stayed the same or decreased.


Here I used basic concepts of NLP which is Bag-of-words for converting text into vectors and used RandomForest Classifier for Prediction.
